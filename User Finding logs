Takeaways: 
Students are always on their phones (mobile), some don’t even use a laptop
Students do not really think about scholarships until they are applying to colleges or sometimes even after -- lots of times this is too late
Scholarships that apply to a particular student are not easy to find, lots of information on the internet is not helpful or full of noise
Lots of scholarships are searched for just by typing in demographic or other key characteristics of the student in Google
Only the advertised scholarships for major companies are well known (Taco Bell scholarship on social media)
Parents not necessarily involved in the pursuit of scholarships at her school
Students would be more likely to apply to scholarships if they knew how many applicants they were competing with or if they had a better sense of whether they could win
Long essays turn students off to scholarships

Takeaways: 
Think about Private vs. University vs. Government types of scholarships
Grades still have their flaws for comparing students across the country, must keep that in mind
Should consider restricting the types of students we are targeting in order to start off
This can be part of the system requirements
This can instead be done organically where anyone can join but the types of available scholarships favor a certain type of student
Research how FAFSA works and the types of data that is collected as part of it, is there anyway we can access this data from FAFSA or from a secondary source?
Think about focusing “local” where smaller companies donate to students in their local area
Socioeconomics or “need” will entice private scholarships the most
Need to consider stewardship of the scholarships, what will the firm retrieve in return for their donation, how will they feel that they did the right thing and are being recognized for their donations
Firms will donate to a certain type of individual if they want to gain appreciation from that type of individual to go work at/invest in their firm
Larger firms might be a target once the brand and product are more established

Takeaways: 
Marketplace idea seems to have real merit
Engineering and technology companies would most likely have some interest in this
Need to distinguish whether you are accessing existing scholarships or enticing the creation of new ones
Donors need to receive publicity for their donations in some shape or form
Focus about student financial need more, possibly self-select based on the scholarships offered by firms
There are some potential legal pitfalls with this idea that need to be evaluated
IRS tax code for charitable donation write-offs
WIll our company be considered a non-profit
Anti-discrimination civil rights issues (if it seems that scholarships offered in our application are discriminatory)
Potential Value Prop: reducing transaction costs and set up time for businesses that do not have the resources to participate in charitable giving of scholarships themselves
Local chambers of commerce and rotary clubs are good resources for feeling out interest of small and medium sized businesses 
Suburban area businesses may feel “closer” to their local neighborhoods than urban area businesses so may need to think about those two types differently with our approach
